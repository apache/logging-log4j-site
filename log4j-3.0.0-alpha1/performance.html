<p>Apart from functional requirements, an important reason for selecting a
logging library is often how well it fulfills non-functional
requirements like reliability and performance.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This page compares the performance of a number of logging frameworks
(java.util.logging "JUL", Logback, Log4j 1.2 and Log4j 2.6), and
documents some performance trade-offs for Log4j 2 functionality.</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Performance can mean different things to different people. Common terms
in this context are throughput and latency: <em>Throughput</em> is a measure of
capacity and can be expressed in a single number: how many messages can
be logged in a certain period of time. <em>Response time latency</em> is how
long it takes to log a message. This cannot be expressed in a single
number because each measurement has its own response time and we are
often most interested in the outliers: how many there were and how large
they were.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When evaluating a logging framework&#8217;s performance these may be useful
questions to ask:</p>
</div>
<div class="qlist qanda">
<ol>
<li>
<p><em>What is its <strong>peak throughput</strong>?</em></p>
<p>Many systems that react to external
events need to log bursts of messages followed by periods of relative
quiet. This number is the maximum throughput measured over a short
period of time and gives some idea of how well the logging library deals
with bursts. For systems that need to log a lot at a constant high rate
(for example, batch jobs) this is less likely to be a useful measure of
performance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>What is the <strong>maximum sustained throughput</strong>?</em></p>
<p>This is the throughput
averaged over a long time. This is a useful measure of the "upper limit"
of the capacity of the logging library. It is not recommended that
reactive applications actually log at this rate since under this load
they will likely experience jitter and large response time spikes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>What is its <strong>response time</strong> behaviour under various loads?</em></p>
<p>This is the
most important question for applications that need to react to external
events in a timely manner. Response time is the total amount of time it
takes to log a message and is the sum of the service time and wait time.
The <strong>service time</strong> is the time it takes to do the work to log the
message. As the workload increases, the service time often varies
little: to do X amount of work it always takes X amount of time. The
<strong>wait time</strong> is how long the request had to wait in a queue before being
serviced. <em>As the workload increases, wait time often grows to many
times the service time.</em></p>

<p>What is often measured and reported as <em>latency</em> is actually <em>service

subsequent events. This may present results that are more optimistic

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The graph on the right illustrates how much more optimistic service time
is than response time. The graph shows response time and service time
for the same system under a load of 100,000 messages per second. Out of
24 million measurements, only ~50 are more than 250 microseconds, less
than 0.001%. In a service time-only graph this would hardly be visible.
However, the depending on the load it will take a while to catch up
after a spike.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The response time graph shows that in reality many more events are
impacted by these delays than the service time numbers alone would
suggest.</p>

<h3 id="asyncLogging">Asynchronous Logging - Peak Throughput Comparison</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Asynchronous logging is useful to deal with bursts of events. How this
works is that a minimum amount of work is done by the application thread
to capture all required information in a log event, and this log event
is then put on a queue for later processing by a background thread. As
long as the queue is sized large enough, the application threads should
be able to spend very little time on the logging call and return to the
business logic very quickly.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It turns out that the choice of queue is extremely important for peak
throughput. Log4j 2&#8217;s Async Loggers use a
<a href="https://lmax-exchange.github.io/disruptor/">lock-free data structure</a>,
whereas Logback, Log4j 1.2 and Log4j 2&#8217;s Asynchronous Appenders use an
ArrayBlockingQueue. With a blocking queue, multi-threaded applications
often experience lock contention when trying to enqueue the log event.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The graph below illustrates the difference a lock-free data structure
can make to throughput in multi-threaded scenarios. <em>Log4j 2 scales
better with the number of threads: an application with more threads can
log more. The other logging libraries suffer from lock contention and
total throughput stays constant or drops when more threads are logging.
This means that with the other logging libraries, each individual thread
will be able to log less.</em></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Bear in mind that this is <em>peak</em> throughput: Log4j 2&#8217;s Async Loggers
give better throughput up to a point, but once the queue is full, the
appender thread needs to wait until a slot becomes available in the
queue, and throughput will drop to the maximum sustained throughput of
the underlying appenders at best.</p>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="asyncLoggingResponseTime">Asynchronous Logging Response Time</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Response time behaviour varies a lot with the workload and the number of
threads that log concurrently. The <a href="manual/async.html#Latency">Async
Loggers</a> manual page and the
<a href="manual/garbagefree.html#Latency">garbage-free logging</a> manual page
provide some graphs showing response time behaviour under various loads.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This section shows another graph showing response time latency behaviour
under a modest total workload of 64,000 messages per second, with 4
threads logging concurrently. At this load and on this hardware/OS/JVM
configuration, lock contention and context switches play less of a role
and the pauses are mostly caused by minor garbage collections. Garbage
collection pause duration and frequency can vary a lot: when testing the
Log4j 1.2.17 Async Appender a minor GC pause of 7 milliseconds occurred
while the Log4j 2 Async Appender test only saw a GC pause of a little
over 2 milliseconds. This does not necessarily mean that one is better
than the other.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Generally, garbage-free async loggers had the best response time
behaviour in all configurations we tested.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><span class="image"><img src="images/ResponseTimeAsyncLogging4Threads@16kEach.png" alt="Response time comparison"/></span></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The above result was obtained with the ResponseTimeTest class which can
be found in the Log4j 2 unit test source directory, running on JDK
1.8.0_45 on RHEL 6.5 (Linux 2.6.32-573.1.1.el6.x86_64) with 10-core Xeon
CPU E5-2660 v3 @2.60GHz with hyperthreading switched on (20 virtual
cores).</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="asyncLoggingWithParams">Asynchronous Logging Parameterized Messages</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Many logging libraries offer an API for logging parameterized messages.
This enables application code to look something like this:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-java" data-lang="java">logger.debug("Entry number: {} is {}", i, entry[i]);</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the above example, the fully formatted message text is not created
unless the DEBUG level is enabled for the logger. Without this API, you
would need three lines of code to accomplish the same:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-java" data-lang="java">if (logger.isDebugEnabled()) {
    logger.debug("Entry number: " + i + " is " + entry[i].toString());
}</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If the DEBUG level <em>is</em> enabled, then at some point the message needs to
be formatted. When logging asynchronously, the message parameters may be
changed by the application thread before the background thread had a
chance to log the message. This would show the wrong values in the log
file. To prevent this, Log4j 2, Log4j 1.2 and Logback format the message
text in the application thread <em>before</em> passing off the log event to the
background thread.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is the safe thing to do, but the formatting has a performance cost.
The graph below compares the throughput of logging messages with
parameters using various logging libraries. These are all asynchronous
logging calls, so these numbers do not include the cost of disk I/O and
represent <em>peak</em> throughput.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>JUL (java.util.logging) does not have a built-in asynchronous Handler.

is the nearest thing available so we included it here. MemoryHandler
does <em>not</em> do the safe thing of taking a snapshot of the current
parameter state (it just keeps a reference to the original parameter
objects), and as a result it is very fast when single-threaded. However,
when more application threads are logging concurrently, the cost of lock
contention outweighs this gain.</p>

more constant.</em></p>

<h3 id="asyncLoggingWithLocation">Asynchronous Logging with Caller Location Information</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Some layouts can show the class, method and line number in the
application where the logging call was made. In Log4j 2, examples of
such layout options are HTML
<a href="layouts.html#HtmlLocationInfo">locationInfo</a>, or one of the patterns
<a href="layouts.html#PatternClass">%C or $class</a>,

<a href="layouts.html#PatternLine">%L or %line</a>,
<a href="layouts.html#PatternMethod">%M or %method</a>. In order to provide
caller location information, the logging library will take a snapshot of
the stack, and walk the stack trace to find the location information.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The graph below shows the performance impact of capturing caller
location information when logging asynchronously from a single thread.

<h3 id="fileLoggingComparison">Synchronous File Logging - Sustained Throughput Comparison</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This section discusses the maximum sustained throughput of logging to a
file. In any system, the maximum sustained throughput is determined by
its slowest component. In the case of logging, this is the appender,
where the message formatting and disk I/O takes place. For this reason
we will look at simple <em>synchronous</em> logging to a file, without queues
or background threads.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The graph below compares Log4j 2.6&#8217;s RandomAccessFile appender to the
respective File appenders of Log4j 1.2.17, Logback 1.1.7 and Java util
logging (JUL) on Oracle Java 1.8.0_45. ImmediateFlush was set to false
for all loggers that support this. The JUL results are for the
XMLFormatter (which in our measurements was about twice as fast as the
SimpleFormatter).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>Log4j 2&#8217;s sustained throughput drops a little when more threads are
logging simultaneously, but its fine-grained locking pays off and
throughput stays relatively high. The other logging frameworks'
throughput drops dramatically in multi-threaded applications: Log4j 1.2
has 1/4th of its single-threaded capacity, Logback has 1/10th of its
single-threaded capacity, and JUL steadily drops from 1/4th to 1/10th of
its single-threaded throughput as more threads are added.</em></p>

<h3 id="filtering">Filtering by Level</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The most basic filtering a logging framework provides is filtering by
log level. When logging is turned off entirely or just for a set of
Levels, the cost of a log request consists of a number of method
invocations plus an integer comparison. Unlike Log4j, Log4j 2 Loggers
don&#8217;t "walk a hierarchy". Loggers point directly to the Logger
configuration that best matches the Logger&#8217;s name. This incurs extra
overhead when the Logger is first created but reduces the overhead every
time the Logger is used.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="advanced_filtering">Advanced Filtering</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Both Logback and Log4j 2 support advanced filtering. Logback calls them
TurboFilters while Log4j 2 has a single Filter object. Advanced
filtering provides the capability to filter LogEvents using more than
just the Level before the events are passed to Appenders. However, this
flexibility does come with some cost. Since multi-threading can also
have an impact on the performance of advanced filtering, the chart below
shows the difference in performance of filtering based on a Marker or a
Marker&#8217;s parent.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The "Simple Marker" comparison checks to see if a Marker that has no
references to other markers matches the requested Marker. The "Parent
Marker" comparison checks to see if a Marker that does have references
to other markers matches the requested Marker.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It appears that coarse-grained synchronization in SLF4J can impact
performance in multi-threaded scenarios. See

<p>Log4j and Logback also support filtering on a value in the Log4j
ThreadContext vs filtering in Logback on a value in the MDC. The graph
below shows that the performance difference between Log4j 2 and Logback
is small for the ThreadContext filter.</p>

<h2 id="tradeoffs">Trade-offs</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="whichAppender">Which Log4j 2 Appender to Use?</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Assuming that you selected Log4j 2 as your logging framework, next you
may be interested in learning what the performance trade-offs are for
selecting a specific Log4j 2 configuration. For example, there are three
appenders for logging to a file: the File, RandomAccessFile and
MemoryMappedFile appenders. Which one should you use?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If performance is all you care about, the graphs below show your best
choice is either the MemoryMappedFile appender or the RandomAccessFile
appender. Some things to bear in mind:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>MemoryMappedFile appender does not have a rolling variant yet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When the log file size exceeds the MemoryMappedFile&#8217;s region length,
the file needs to be remapped. This can be a very expensive operation,
taking several seconds if the region is large.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>MemoryMappedFile appender creates a presized file from the beginning
and fills it up gradually. This can confuse tools like <code>tail</code>; many such
tools don&#8217;t work very well with memory mapped files.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On Windows, using a tool like <code>tail</code> on a file created by
RandomAccessFile appender can hold a lock on this file which may prevent
Log4j from opening the file again when the application is restarted. In
a development environment where you expect to restart your application
regularly while using tools like tail to view the log file contents, the
File appender may be a reasonable trade-off between performance and
flexibility. For production environments performance may have higher
priority.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The graph below shows sustained throughput for the console and file
appenders in Log4j 2.6, and for reference also provides the 2.5
performance.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It turns out that the garbage-free text encoding logic in 2.6 gives
these appenders a performance boost compared to Log4j 2.5. It used to be
that the RandomAccessFile appender was significantly faster, especially
in multi-threaded scenarios, but with the 2.6 release the File appender
performance has improved and the performance difference between these
two appender is smaller.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Another takeaway is just how much of a performance drag logging to the
console can be. Considering logging to a file and using a tool like
<code>tail</code> to watch the file change in real time.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><span class="image"><img src="images/Log4j2AppenderThroughputComparison-linux.png" alt="image"/></span></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>On Windows, the results are similar but the RandomAccessFile and
MemoryMappedFile appenders outperform the plain File appender in
multi-threaded scenarios. The absolute numbers are higher on Windows: we
don&#8217;t know why but it looks like Windows handles lock contention better
than Linux.</p>
